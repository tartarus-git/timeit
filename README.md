# timeit
A command-line utility to time programs. Works very nicely within piped chains of programs and the output is easily machine-readable. Only available for Windows.

# How To Build
Open up the Visual Studio solution file in Visual Studio and build the project in whichever way you want (with/without optimizations, x86/x64, etc...).

**ALTERNATIVELY:** Built binaries are located in the builds folder. Those are ready to go.

# How To Install
There's nothing to install. Copy the finished binary to where ever you want it to be and start using it. It's got no dependencies.

# Usage
It's very similar to the Linux ```time``` utility as far as it's usage is concerned. More details can be found with ```timeit --help```.
